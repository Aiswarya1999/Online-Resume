    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <hr>
    <p> I am an MSc graduate in Computer Forensics and Cybersecurity from the University of Greenwich, with a strong 
        background in information security frameworks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and NIST. My experience includes 
        performing vulnerability assessments, security audits, and risk analysis, as well as hands-on work in programming 
        (Python, Java, Web Development) and AI implementation. I excel at tracking and reporting security metrics, 
        addressing security risks, and supporting compliance efforts. Currently pursuing the CompTIA Security+ 
        certification, I am committed to enhancing my expertise in security and compliance. I am passionate about 
        contributing to roles in cybersecurity, compliance, or software development, leveraging my technical skills, 
        collaborative approach, and dedication to innovation. I am available to work in the UK under a Graduate Visa until 
        February 2026.
